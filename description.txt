简单来说，修复了这个视频里的问题：

强制将Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture设为了en-US版本，详细说明在英文版有写
总之就是UTF8比UTF32要快4倍
其实还得是Mod作者的问题，拜托你好好写ModContent.Request，别每帧Request一个！

All the languages other than English will cause mods to lag in certain situations
The conditions include but not limited to:
- Ares' rotating laser attack(Calamity)
- WoF's ichor attack(Fargo's Soul)
- Astrageldon's Phase 2(Catalyst)
When they lag, fps will drop a lot, even to 1 or 2, for several seconds. And when game's language is switched to English, they don't lag in those conditions.
It has been tested by multiple players using different PC with different mods loaded

Why?
If Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture is not English, all operations on string will use the UTF32 range.
If it is English, will use the UTF8 range. Which is 4 times faster than UTF32.
So ReLogic.Content.CleanPath will be 4 times faster.
This mod 

However, if the modders use ModContent.Request currectly (use a static field to store the texture), the issue will never happen.
